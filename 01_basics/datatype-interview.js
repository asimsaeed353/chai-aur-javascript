/* Datatypes are classified into two types. This classification is based on how the data is stored in memory and how data is accessed from the memory
This is similar to the concept of call by value and call by reference.

i) Primitive Datatypes
ii) Non-primitive datatypes / Reference Datatypes

*/

/*
    # Primitive Datatypes (call by value)

        You are not given access of these datatypes rather you get the copy of these values.

    i)      String
    ii)     Number      
    iii)    Boolean
    iv)     Null
    v)      Undefined
    vi)     Symbol
    vii)    BigInt

*/

/*
    # Non-primitive Datatypes / Reference Datatypes

        These are datatypes which are passed by referece i.e. you can access their location in the memory

    i)      Arrays
    ii)     Objects
    iii)    Functions

/* Statically Typed vs Dynamically Typed */

/* * 
    # Statically Typed Language: 
        You know the datatype of the variable at the compile time. 
        Example: in C++, you tell explicitly the type of the variable i.e. 'int', 'string', 'char', etc

    # Dynamically Typed Language: 
        The datatype of the variable is not known at the compile time. The type is decided at the runtime according to the value that the variable holds (int, string, object).
        Example: in JavaScript, you declare the variables of any datatype with just 'let', or 'var' or 'const' regardless of the datatype of the variable.

/* JavaScript is Dynamically typed language */
